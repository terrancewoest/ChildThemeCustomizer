# ChildThemeCustomizer
A simple wrapper wordpress plugin that is meant to be customized!

You can use it to add custom filters and actions to a wordpress theme or child theme.

This is helpful if you don't want to create a whole child theme, or you want to customize a child theme and you run into the issue of grandchild themes not being a thing.

Comes with a class that calls in a custom css file, js file, and a sass file for those that are into preprocessors.

Feel free to add more hooks and filters into the class's constructor function to do whatever cool stuff you want to.

Take it, use it, change it, abuse it, whatever ya want.
